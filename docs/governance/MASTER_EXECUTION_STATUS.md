# TCDX GRC — Master Execution Status

`MASTER_REGENT=TCDX_GRC_MASTER_REGENT_BASELINE_v1.4_2026-09-15`
`BASELINE_STATUS=ACTIVE`
`RECTOR_BASELINE=PASS`
`RECTOR_DOCUMENT_CONSISTENCY=PASS`

## CI rector

`RECTOR_CI_WORKFLOW=Rector Governance Gate`
`RECTOR_REQUIRED_CHECK_NAME=rector-governance`
`RECTOR_CI_EXECUTION=PASS`
`MAIN_RULESET=TCDX GRC Main Governance`
`MAIN_RULESET_ENFORCEMENT=ACTIVE`
`MAIN_REQUIRED_STATUS_CHECK=rector-governance`
`MAIN_BYPASS_ACTORS=0`

The rector workflow is operational and the repository ruleset enforces pull requests and the required `rector-governance` status check on the default branch. Force-pushes and branch deletion are blocked and no bypass actors are configured.

## Human approval — Phase 1

`PHYSICAL_MODEL_APPROVED_COMMIT=a822bb92d0d585edd84adc8a1c65ec280923cc8e`
`PHYSICAL_DATA_MODEL_REVIEW=PASS`
`PHYSICAL_MODEL_DESIGN=COMPLETE`
`PHYSICAL_MODEL_HUMAN_APPROVAL_DATE=2026-09-15`

The human project authority approved the PostgreSQL 16 physical model corresponding to commit `a822bb92d0d585edd84adc8a1c65ec280923cc8e` after independent architectural review.

## Human approval — Phase 2

`EXECUTABLE_CONTRACTS_APPROVED_COMMIT=16deeafc0237f219d08d44f5d5a27c62ae4cc909`
`EXECUTABLE_CONTRACTS=PASS`
`EXECUTABLE_CONTRACTS_DESIGN=COMPLETE`
`EXECUTABLE_CONTRACTS_HUMAN_APPROVAL_DATE=2026-09-15`

The human project authority explicitly approved H-001 through H-006 and the executable contracts corresponding to commit `16deeafc0237f219d08d44f5d5a27c62ae4cc909` after independent review.

## Current authorized phase

`FOUNDATIONS_IMPLEMENTATION=AUTHORIZED`
`DATABASE_INITIALIZATION=AUTHORIZED_WITHIN_PHASE_3_CONTRACT`
`MIGRATIONS=AUTHORIZED_WITHIN_PHASE_3_CONTRACT`
`FOUNDATIONS_RUNTIME=PENDING`
`FUNCTIONAL_PRODUCT_SLICES=BLOCKED`

Phase 2 is closed. Phase 3 may create the definitive PostgreSQL database objects, execute the approved initial migration set and canonical seeds, and implement only the foundations defined by the master plan and executable contracts. Product-domain functional slices beyond foundations remain blocked until `FOUNDATIONS_RUNTIME=PASS` and their subsequent gates authorize them.

This file is mutable execution state. It is not part of the immutable rector baseline and cannot override it.
